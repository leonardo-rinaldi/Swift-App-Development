Exercise - Arrays

Assume you are an event coordinator for a community charity event and are keeping a list of who has registered. 
Create a variable registrationList that will hold strings. It should be empty after initialization.

Your friend Sara is the first to register for the event. Add her name to registrationList using the append(_:) 
method. Print the contents of the collection.

App Exercise - Activity Challenge

Your fitness tracking app shows users a list of possible challenges, grouped by activity type 
(i.e. walking challenges, running challenges, calisthenics challenges, weightlifting challenges, etc.)
A challenge could be as simple as "Walk 3 miles a day" or as intense as "Run 5 times a week."

Using arrays of type String, create at least two lists, one for walking challenges, and one for running challenges. 
Each should have at least two challenges and should be initialized using an array literal. Feel free to create more lists 
for different activities.
*/

In your app you want to show all of these lists on the same screen grouped into sections. 
Create a challenges array that holds each of the lists you have created (it will be an array of arrays).
Using challenges, print the first element in the second challenge list.

All of the challenges will reset at the end of the month. Use the removeAll to remove everything from challenges.

Write an if statement that will use isEmpty to check if there is anything in the array. If there is not, print a statement 
asking the user to commit to a challenge. Add an else-if statement that will print "The challenge you have chosen is

Exercise - Dictionaries

Create a variable [String: Int] dictionary that can be used to look up the number of days in a particular month.

and March has 31. Print the dictionary.

App Exercise - Pacing

In previous app exercises you've written code to help users with run pacing. 
You decide that you could use a dictionary to let users store different paces 
that they regularly run at or do interval training with.

Create a dictionary paces of type [String: Double] and assign it a dictionary literal with 
"Easy", "Medium", and "Fast" keys corresponding to values of 10.0, 8.0, and 6.0. These numbers 
correspond to mile pace in minutes. Print the dictionary.
*/

/*
Add a new key/value pair to the dictionary. The key should be "Sprint" and the value should be 4.0. Print the dictionary.
*/

pace["Sprint"] = 4.0
print(pace)

/*
Imagine the user in question gets faster over time and decides to update his/her pacing on runs. Update the values of "Medium" 
and "Fast" to 7.5 and 5.8, respectively. Print the dictionary.
*/

pace.updateValue(7.5, forKey: "Medium")
pace.updateValue(5.8, forKey: "Fast")

/*
Imagine the user in question decides not to store "Sprint" as one his/her regular paces. Remove "Sprint" from the dictionary. 
Print the dictionary.
*/

pace.removeValue(forKey: "Sprint")
print(pace)

/*
When a user chooses a pace, you want the app to print a statement stating that it will keep him/her on pace. Imagine a user 
chooses "Medium." Accessing the value from the dictionary, print a statement saying "Okay! I'll keep you at a 
<INSERT PACE VALUE HERE> minute mile pace."
